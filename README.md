## Welcome

Welcome to **Titan All Stars** guild playing **Hero Wars** on server 20 **Tempered Steel**.  

Newbies and experienced players looking for a fresh start are all welcome. <br>
Enthusism and consistency is as important as experience. With those, we can build you into a strong player valuable to the team.

Of course, you should know [why a guild is useful to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_-sNpLHeOw)

Swing by our  **[Discord Chat Server](https://discord.gg/KPpxgdD)** to chat. <br>
Actually having only just configured the server, I (Pallus) am the only one there at the moment - and its a bit lonely.
But once it picks up it co-ordination should be easier - not having to keep backing out of the game play to get to the chat.


## Get your titan name 
If you're ammenable, get with the theme and **[choose a Titan name from this list](https://www.theoi.com/greek-mythology/titans.html)** (or elsewhere) <br>
Change your in-game name by clicking your profile icon in top left of screen. <br>

## Titanite
* The optimal amount of titanite to mine each day is 150. You have two daily quests with targets of 75 and 150, which EACH return you ONE Titan Summoning Sphere. Doing beyond 150 a day moves you into harder territory with less sphere power-ups.  Note, if you have Valkyrie's Favor and get a bonus 150, you should be aiming for 300 total.
* The guild target is 3000 per day, which returns each member THREE Titan Summoning Spheres.  This is easy to achieve if everyone chips in - even if only 20 of the 30 guild members make the quota. Lets help each other get those bonus spheres.
* This is a vituous cycle. The additional titan levelling from the extra Summoning Spheres allows you to more easily mine titanite.
* Levelling up your titans provides "Sparks" to power-up your heros' Gift Of The Elements.

## Emeralds
* Generally, here is [where to spend your emeralds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYDR0TkNnDU&feature=emb_rel_pause)
* Its beneficial to spending your first emeralds powering-up your Titans up to between levels 10 to 15, to kick off a virtuous-cycle of titanite gathering.  Strong titans also greatly assist the Guild Wars.      
* Do also open three chests up per Outland Boss win, to get additional Artifact Coins.  Use those Artifact Coins to power-up your A-Team's first artifacts to 100%-Activation. 
* Minimise emerald to coin conversions - unless some special event gives extreme bonuses.
* Avoid opening extra chests in Tower.  As a general rule only open ONE-OF-THREE Tower Chests, unless you see something particularly needful.  
* Do look for the red-dot on emerald buttons as shown below...  
![Chest Buttons](https://herowars.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360039180114/mceclip0.png)      
which returns more emeralds than you spend through the attached Quest (in this case an extra 500)...

##  Member performance

The point of a guild is to assist each other to progress through the game.  
Hero Wars is easy to free-to-play - so there are a lot of transient sightseers, or players that make a start then lose interest.
We would like to leave slots free for new blood (beginner or experienced) who are ethusiastic about progressing in the game.
To this end, there need to be some criteria with which to leave those slots open.
The in-game progress tables located under **Gifts > View** provide the best measure of performance.

Unless otherwise arranged with elder members, candidates-to-be-dropped will be prioritised as follows...
1. Low Titanite total - lack of interest in helping your fellow members (75 or 150 a day helps keep the doctor away)
1. Early Activity followed by no activity - not playing the game
1. Low overall Activity per rolling weekly Total - not playing the game
1. Player name not changed from default - not engaged in the game

Membership management will be frequent, but particularly on Tuesday when it becomes apparent that weekend-only players are not contributing during the week.
If you are dropped for lack of activity, do feel free to rejoin for the periods when you have more time to commit.  Just don't leave us hanging.  Communication is the key.

## Guild War
* The War Party consists of FIFTEEN "guild champion" battle teams seleected daily.
* Winning a battle rewards guild champions with trophies to buy Hero Skin power-ups.
* Obviously, to win, the most powerful of the teams are prioritised, but there is also always lower level mop up that gives less powerful players a chance to participate.  
* In the past, things have broken down when less committed players simply don't turn up for the battle.  Points are lost, league standing lowered and rewards reduced.  This usually occurs with lower level players, so lower level positions potentially open each day.  
* If you want a run in the War Party, just ask.   
* The most important thing about being selected for the War Party is reliability.  
* Its **REALLY BAD** for us if you don't turn up.
* The War Party is locked-in a day in advance.  If you are not going to be able to attend, **please communicate** to opt-out. 
* Good communication will be viewed very favourably in considering more permanent placement in the War Party.  
* Show your commitment and reliability to your guild mates by regularly completing you quota of 150 titanite.

## War Party Order Of Business 
If you have been selected as a Guild Champion and thus critical to the day's battle, you are requested to: 
1. As soon as you log in, announce your arrival in Guild Chat like this... "WAR: Reviewing my assigned target now."  (Note, also let us know any real-world constraints on your period of play.)

2. Review your assigned targets on the Battle Map. Note that these assignments were just the initial plans.  **WAR IS VOLATILE!!** Plans may change since: <br>
a. your opponent powered up since the task assignment <br>
b. someone else lost a critical battle <br>
c. due to timezone, you've logged in earlier than someone assigned to a critical target, and strategically its better to clear it earlier.

3. Report your evaluation of your match-ups or if you see a better opportunity. Ask for confirmation.
4. While waiting for an answer, go grab your 150 quota of titanite.
5. When you are done, if no answer, advise Guild Chat you are executing your assigned orders.
6. Report your battle results to the Guild Chat.
7. Get on with other business.

Your evaluation of your match-up and opportunities should in general consider the following priority of capturing buildings:
1. Bridge - to reach the citadel.
2. Break through citadel defences - to reach the citadel.
3. Citadel - since if it is done later and we clear 5/6, that will be 5 wasted attacks.
4. Everything else - Focus on capturing full buildings.  A building capture doubles the points earnt in the individual battles. 

Opportunities to look for to help acheive the current priority are:
* swapping assignments, such that both battles will still be won. 

**Now the overarching request is that you communicate.  Thats how battles are won to receive rewards.**

## Titans

## Campaign
* First activity open to beginning players.
* Completing each battle increase the experience of your Heros.
* Completing each battle increases your Team Level - shown beneath your Player Icon in top right of screen. 
* Monitor your progress to next Team Level by watching "Team EXP" after clicking on Player Icon.
* [Developer's info](https://herowars.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025163314-Campaign)   

## Tower
* The best source of coin and rare fragments of equipment.  You should try to reach the top each day.  
* Tower difficulty is based your Team Level, so keep your Hero Level maxed to same as your Team Level.
* Each day, up you Hero Levels, then run the Tower before doing campaigns that up your Team Level.   
* Run your tower battles with extra healers, since damage carries over from battle to battle and doesn't reset until the next day, you will get further.
* Usually only open one chest at a time - emeralds better spent on other things.
* Generally spend skulls on the first (of three) power-up cards.  This is the most efficient and by the time you get to the top you'll have accumulated sufficient cheap powerups to complete the tower. 
* At the end, don't forget to convert both you Skulls and Tower Points into gold. 
* [Developer's info](https://herowars.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/218469648-Tower)

## Adventures
* Opens at level 40.
* Adventures can be run with three players, but can be completed by two (and possibly get more share of loot).
* Don't barge into a running adventure without asking.  Perhaps they are trying to complete it with the minimum players.  
* Adventures dtay open (maybe) 7 days.  (need confirmation)

## Arena
* [Game info](https://herowars.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/218900067-Arena-)

## Outland
* nothing yet

## Encounter strategy
* When fighting bosses, swap out Area Effect heros like Keira for a single target attacker like Arachne.
* When you get the upper hand in an encounter stage, turn off "Auto" so your characters charge to unleash at the start of the next stage.

## Real world money strategy
The elephant in the room is whether games like Hero Wars force you to **Pay To Win**. So far (level 50) it doesn't. 
The general philosophy of this guild is **Free To Play**.  Where is the fun and challenge in just forking over cash for power-ups. 
However if you're going to be spending significant time in the game, a couple of small purchases are recommended...

### VIP Level 1
Benefit: **INSTANT RAID** saves your real-world time when mining for equipment to promote your heros. <br>
Helps you you quickly grind the Dungeon and Tower each day, to get the resources to do other interesting and fun things.

Period: Permanent <br>
![Instant Raid Buttons](https://herowars.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360041242594/mceclip3.png)

### Valkyrie's Favor
Benefit: Combat 5x speed-up saves your real-world time.  Also Arifact Coins and Cores help earlt levelelling of artifacts.  <br>
